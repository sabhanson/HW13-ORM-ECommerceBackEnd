# ORM (Object Relational Mapping) E-Commerce Back End [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description
I built this E-Commerce Back End application using the [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2), [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize), [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv), and [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) packages to connect to a MySQL database.  
It is especially useful for an E-Commerce company to organize their `Categories` of `Products` and the various `Tags` that their products hold.  
It's quick and easy to follow the API routes to `Create`, `Read`, `Update`, and `Delete` data.

``` 
npm install
```
- Connect to the MySQL shell by using this command
```
mysql -u root -p
```
- Enter your password when prompted
- Run this command to create the database where data will be stored
```
SOURCE db/schema.sql;
```
- Now, stop the terminal from running MySQL commands by typing
```
quit;

- Now, run this command to actually seed the data into the database
```
npm run seed
```
- Now actually start the server.js in the integrated terminal by running the following command
```
node server.js
```
(Alternatively, you can run `nodemon server.js` if you have the [Nodemon package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) installed)
